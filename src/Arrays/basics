Array objects are in heap.
Heap objects are not continuous.
Array if not given any values has default values.

datatype[] name = new datatype[size]
// datatype[] name (name getting defines in stack) [compile time]
// new datatype[size] (object is being created in heap memory) [run time] (DMA)

Arrays are mutable
