## Functional Interface
A Functional Interface in Java is an interface that contains exactly one abstract method. It can have multiple default or
static methods, but only one abstract method.
Functional Interfaces are the basis for lambda expressions and method references in Java, introduced in Java 8.
Syntax:
@FunctionalInterface
public interface MyFunctionalInterface {
    void performAction(); // Single abstract method
}
@FunctionalInterface annotation is optional but recommended — it tells the compiler to ensure the interface has only one
abstract method.
Why Use Functional Interfaces?
 To write cleaner and concise code using lambda expressions.
 To implement functional programming in Java.
 To pass behavior as a parameter (functional-style programming).

## Method Reference
Method Reference is a shorthand notation of a lambda expression to call a method. It allows referencing an existing
method by name instead of writing a full lambda.
Introduced in Java 8, method references make code more readable and concise.
Syntax:
ClassName::methodName
or
object::methodName

## Encode Decode
Java provides built-in support for Base64 encoding and decoding through the java.util.Base64 class (introduced in Java 8).
Types of Base64 Encoders/Decoders in Java
Java provides 3 variants under Base64:
1. Base64.getEncoder() : Basic Base64 encoding (single-line
2. Base64.getUrlEncoder() : URL and Filename safe encoding
3. Base64.getMimeEncoder() : MIME friendly encoding (with line breaks)


## Try with resource
Try-with-resources in Java is a feature introduced in Java 7 that helps automatically close resources
such as files, sockets, database connections, etc., once they are no longer needed. This eliminates the need for writing
explicit finally blocks to close these resources.
Works with classes that implement the AutoCloseable interface (or Closeable, which extends AutoCloseable).
Resources are closed automatically, regardless of whether the try block completes normally or abruptly.
We don't need to use finally.
Syntax:
try (ResourceType resource = new ResourceType()) {
// Use the resource
} catch (Exception e) {
    e.printStackTrace();
}


##Type Annotations
Type annotations in Java were introduced with Java 8 (JSR 308) to allow annotations to be placed anywhere a type is used,
not just on declarations. This makes annotations more powerful, especially for tools that analyze or verify code such as
static analyzers, frameworks, or compilers.
Where You Can Use Type Annotations
You can now place annotations in these places:
1. On variable declarations
2. On generic type arguments
3. On casts
4. On implements and extends clauses
5. On method return types
6. On parameters and constructor references
7. On array types

##JSP
JSP stands for JAVA Server Pages.
It is a server side technology. It is used to create dynamic web content.
In this JSP tags are used to insert JAVA code into HTML pages.
No recompilation or redeployment is required.
JSP has access to entire API of JAVA.
JSP are extended version of servlet.

##Servlets
Servlets work on server side.
Servlets are capable of handling complex requests obtained from the web server and able to process it and then able
to provide the dynamic response accordingly.
Servlets, as written in JAVA are platform independent.
