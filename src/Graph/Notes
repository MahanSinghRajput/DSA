Types of graph - Directed, Undirected
Cycle - Start from a node and end at that node.
Path - Contain a lot of nodes and each of them are reachable.
Degree - The total number of edges connected to a node whether going in or out.
         Total degree of a graph = 2 * No of edges of the graph (Undirected)
         Directed : Indegree - edges coming to a node
                    Outdegree - edges going from a node
Edge Weight - Every edge has a weight. default is 1
