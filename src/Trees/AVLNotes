AVL (Adelson Velskii and Landis) tree is a self balancing binary tree.
* For evey node in the tree, the difference in height of left and right subtree of that node is <= 1.

## Steps to balance
1. Insert normally Node n
2. Start from Node n and find the node that makes the tree unbalanced, bottom up.
3. Using one of the 4 rules, rotate.

## 4 rules
1. Left Left case
