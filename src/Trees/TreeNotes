## Tree
* all operations take O(log n)
* ordered storage
* cost efficient
* used in file systems, databases,maths, ML(Decision Tree), algorithms, compression of files and networking

## Properties of a tree
1. size = no. of nodes
2. child and parent
3. siblings
4. edge
5. leaf node
6. height - max no. of edges between two nodes
7. level = height of root - height of node  (level of root = 0)
8. ancestor and descendant
9. degree: no. of children (0,1,2)

## Types of binary tree
1. Complete binary tree: all level full, last full from left to right
2. Full/Strict binary tree: each node has either 0 or 2 children (used in compression and segment tree)
3. Perfect binary tree: all the internal nodes have 2 children and all the leaf nodes are on the same level
4. Height balanced binary tree: average height is O(log n)
5. Skewed binary tree: every node has only one child. height = O(n). It is like linked list
6. Ordered binary tree: every node has some property. Ex: BST

## Useful Properties
1. Perfect BT: if height = h :- total nodes = 2^(h+1) - 1
                                total leaf nodes = 2^h
                                total internal nodes = 2^h - 1
2. if you have N no. of leaves in a binary tree then levels = log(n + 1) at least
   if you have N no. of nodes then log(n + 1) min levels.
3. Strict BT: if N = leaf nodes, then internal nodes = N - 1
              **[ No. of leaf nodes = No. of internal nodes + 1 ]**
4. No. of leaf nodes = No. of internal nodes with 2 children + 1;

##Implementation
1. Linked Representation
2. Sequential

## Binary Search Tree
It is a balanced tree.
