It is used to compress any file.
It is a lossless algorithm.
We use two hashmaps. One is encoder other is decoder.
Steps :-
1. Pass the String (data, aka feeder).
2. Make frequency map.
3. For every key in frequency map create a node and insert that node in a min heap/ PQ.
   Node data : char data, int cost (frequency)
4. Remove two elements from heap and combine them.
No value in the heap is a prefix of the other.
Space Complexity = O(n)
Time Complexity = O(n log(n))
