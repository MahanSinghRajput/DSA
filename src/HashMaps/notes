HashMaps accesses element in constant time.
It stores key value pairs.
Hashmaps are used in compilers and interpreters as well as while creating coding languages to point the names to the variables.
Network Routers also use Hashmaps.
Hashmaps use hashcode() to convert keys to numbers and then access those keys using the same number.


## Chaining
    If two elements have the same key than the values are stored in a linked list.
    Load Factor(alpha) = n/m. (expected key per slot)
    n = no. of keys in a table
    m = size of the table
    Time complexity = O(1 + alpha)

## Division Method
    h(k) = k % m;  m = prime number (not too close to power of 2 or 10)

## Multiplication Method
    h(k) = [(a.k) % (2^w)] >> (w-r);
    a = random number
    w = no. of bits in k
    m = 2^r
    * a is odd and 2^(w-1) < a < 2^w and not too close to 2^(w-1), 2^w

Universal Hashing
    h(k) = [(ak+b) % p] % m;
    a & b are random belonging to [0,p-1]
    probability(h(k1) = h(k2)) = 1/m;

If you want to use a map but also want to keep it in sorted order than use TreeMap.
