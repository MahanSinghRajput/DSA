Locks are used when you use synchronized keyword. Lock is used by the thread accessing the shared resource to prevent it
from getting accessed by other threads.

Every object has its lock when we use "synchronized" then the object uses this lock.

1. Intrinsic - These are built into every object in java. You don't see them, but they're there. When we use "synchronized"
               keyword you're using these automatic locks.

2. Explicit - These are more advanced locks you can control yourself using the Lock class from java.util.concurrent.locks
              You explicitly say when to lock and unlock, giving you more control over how and when people can write in notebook.
