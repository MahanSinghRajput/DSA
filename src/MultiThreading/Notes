# Program - Set of instructions written in a programming language that tells the computer how to perform a specific task.

# Process - It is an instance of a program that is being executed. When a program runs the OS creates a process to manage
            its execution.

# Threads - It is the smallest unit of execution within a process. A process can have multiple threads, which share the
            same resources but can run independently.
            Ex: A web browser can use multiple threads for different tabs, with each tab running as a simple thread.

# Multitasking - It allows an OS to run multiple processes simultaneously. On single core CPUs this is done through time
                 sharing, rapidly switching between tasks. On multi-core CPUs, true parallel execution occurs with tasks
                 distributed across cores. The OS scheduler balances the load, ensuring efficient and responsive system
                 performance.
               - It utilizes the capability of the CPU and it cores. OS can assign different tasks to different cores.
                 This is more efficient than assigning all tasks to a single core.

# Multithreading - It refers to the ability to execute multiple threads within a single process concurrently.
                   It enhances the efficiency of multitasking by breaking down individual tasks into smaller sub-tasks or
                   threads. These threads can be processed simultaneously, making better use of the CPUs capabilities.
                   In a single-core system:
                        Both threads and processes are managed by the OS scheduler through time slicing and context
                        switching to create the illusion of simultaneous execution.
                   In a multi-core system:
                        Both threads and processes can run in true parallel on different cores, with the OS scheduler
                        distributing tasks across the cores to optimize performance.

# Time Slicing - Definition: Time slicing divides CPU time into small intervals called time slices or quanta.
                 Function: The OS scheduler allocates these time slices to different processes and threads, ensuring
                           each gets a fair share of CPU time.
                 Purpose: This prevents any single process or thread from monopolizing the CPU, improving responsiveness
                          and enabling concurrent execution.

# Context Switching - Definition: Context switching is the process of saving the state of a currently running process or
                                  thread and loading the state of the next one to be executed.
                      Function: When a process or thread's time slice expires, the OS scheduler performs a context switch
                                to move the CPU's focus to another process or thread.
                      Purpose: This allows multiple processes and threads to share the CPU, giving the appearance of
                               simultaneous execution on a single-core CPU or improving parallelism on multi-core CPUs.

-> Multitasking can be achieved through multithreading where each task is divided into threads that are managed concurrently.
-> While multitasking typically refers to the running of multiple applications, multithreading is more granular dealing
   with multiple threads within the same application or process.
-> Multitasking operates at the level of processes, which are the operating system's primary units of execution.
-> Multithreading operates at the level of threads, which are smaller units within a process.
-> Multitasking allows us to run multiple applications simultaneously, improving productivity and system utilization.
-> Multithreading allows a single application to perform multiple tasks at the same time, improving application
   performance and responsiveness.

** JAVA's multithreading is included in java.lang package, making it easy to implement concurrent execution.
When a JAVA program starts one thread becomes running immediately which is called the main thread. This thread is
responsible for executing the main method of a program.

To create a new thread in JAVA you can either extend the Thread class or implement the Runnable interface.
If you extend Thread class then override the run() function, and start() method is called to execute it.

If you use runnable interface then override the function run()
then you will need to create an object say obj of the class implementing runnable and then create an object of Thread
by calling obj. Ex: Thread t1 = new Thread(obj); then t1.start();
