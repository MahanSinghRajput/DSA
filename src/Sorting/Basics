## Bubble Sort
   *first pass -> largest element at its position (at last).
   *after every step the elements are arranged to the last.
   *Space Complexity -> O(1) // no extra space (constant)
   *Time Complexity -> O(n) //best case
                      O(n^2) //worst case
   *Stable sorting algorithm (order must be same for equal values).

## Selection Sort
   *Select an element put it at its correct inex.
   *Time Complexity -> O(n^2) // both best and worst
   *Not stable
   *It performs well on small list.

## Insertion Sort
   *for every index put that index element at the correct index of LHS.
   *Time Complexity -> O(n^2) // worst case
                       O(n) // best case
   *Adaptive (steps gets reduced)
   *number of swaps reduced as compared to bubble sort.
   *Stable
   *Used for similar values of N.
   *works good when array is partially sorted.
   *It takes part in hybrid sorting algorithm.
   *Used in internal sorting algorithm.

## Cyclic Sort
   *When given numbers from 1 to N use cyclic sort.
   *Time complexity -> O(n) // best and worst
   *If range -> [0,n] - every element will be at index = value
                [1,n] - every element will be at inex = value - 1
   *Ques - 448, 41
